Assignment One

Initially, what I did was set up the Car scaffold, with fields for make, model, country, and vin (I am aware now that make should have its own scaffold, I have made that change in assignment 2), the Part scaffold, with the field name, and the CarsParts scaffold, which set up the connection between Car and Part. After I set up the scaffolds, I went in and set up the many to many relationships between Car and Part and one to one relationship between Car, Part, and CarsParts. This process was fairly straight forward and my web app ran perfectly. 

I changed the parameters which should be accepted in each default scaffold, and allowed for the Part and Car to be linked without any problems. Ultimately what was left was just the html forms, which were fairly straightforward to do. 

I first attempted to have a drop down with several options being able to be selected for parts when creating a car, however it was not working correctly, so I ended up opting for the check boxes, which in my opinion don't look as clean, but work better than the drop down menu.
